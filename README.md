# Movie-Recommender

It is a python based project that helps us to get related movie based on the movie You previously watched. The movie are suggested based on the review giveing by other users. 

We used Pearson Correlation for calculating the relation between two number. If the movies are related it gives a positive result if not its gives negative or else its give zero as a result. 

Here is just an prototype with a fixed data set. But this could be usefull with tweeks to other set of data. For the purpose of showing the power of pearson correlation we used a fixed data set. 

Do enjoy the code and if could be improved do send me pull request.
thanks!
